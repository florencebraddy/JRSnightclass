    <p class = "paragraph-one">I began my journey into the world of coding on Monday November 18th 2019. The only previous experience I had was taking a few classes with my husband, and working through some of code academy's content. This blog is intended to showcase what I have learnt, what I am currently learning, and my endevors to craft the art of coding.
